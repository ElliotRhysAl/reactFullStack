        <p>I'm Elliot, a self taught developer. (if you will)
          I'm currently learning web development with a focus on front end, <br/> but I am also looking into deployments,
          backend services, data and everything, else under the sun!
        <br/>
        <br/>
          Feel free to take a look through my site, let me know what you think! Everything is stored on my pulic Github Repo. 
        <br/>All the work is my own using various sources from across the web to achieve this. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I hope that some of the functions/code/documetation on there can either help you to make something, 
        <br/>or help me to improve off feedback from the programming world!
        </p>
